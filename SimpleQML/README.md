# SimpleQML
This application shows the basic usage of QML files.

QML is a type of Qt-specific descriptive programming language that is widely used for UI design. 
Compared with traditional `.ui` file design, QML file handles much more types and signals and is 
more efficient to use.

Traditionally `.ui` file can only do interface design and all signal handlings have to be done in 
C++ codes. However, with the advantage of QML, basic signal handlings such as `onButtonClick()` can 
also be done in descriptive files.

What's more, QML also supports import of Javascript files, which greatly enhances its flexibility.

## What This Application Does
This application shows the simple usage of displaying "Hello World" on clicking one button and

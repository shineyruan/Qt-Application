From the early sixties … there was a counter-tradition in rock and roll 
that had much more in common with high art—in particular avant-garde art—
than the ballyhooed art-rock synthesis [progressive rock]; it involved 
more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock and roll 
as material (much as pop artists used mass art in general) and refining, 
elaborating, playing off that material to produce … rockand-roll art. 
While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock and roll was 
or could be as worthy as more established art forms, rock-and-roll art 
came out of an obsessive commitment to the language of rock and roll 
and an equally obsessive disdain for those who rejected that language 
or wanted it watered down, made easier … the new wave has inherited 
the counter-tradition.
